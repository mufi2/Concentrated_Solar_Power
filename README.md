## Introduction
This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of a project focused on optimizing the thermodynamics cycle of a Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) system. The project integrates traditional engineering principles with advanced machine learning algorithms to enhance the efficiency and performance of the CSP system.

## Solar Sub-System
The solar sub-system is a critical component of the CSP system. It is responsible for capturing and concentrating solar energy, which is then converted into thermal energy. The efficiency of the solar sub-system is influenced by various factors, including the design of the heliostats, the receiver's efficiency, and environmental conditions.

## Brayton Cycle Analysis
The Brayton cycle is integral in converting the captured thermal energy into mechanical energy. This section of the project involves a detailed analysis of the gas turbine, heat exchanger, and recuperator. Key performance metrics, such as pressure, temperature, and enthalpy at different stages of the cycle, are calculated and analyzed.

## Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC) Analysis
The project incorporates two ORC cycles to augment the overall efficiency of the energy generation process. Each component of the ORC, including the turbine, condenser, and pump, is meticulously analyzed. The work output and heat rejected by these cycles contribute to the overall performance of the combined cycle.
